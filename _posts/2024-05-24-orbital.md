# The Opportunity for Orbital Data Centers

## Executive summary:
How much does cost of access to low Earth orbit have to diminish before data centers in orbit make economic sense? Roughly 30%. If the price of a Falcon 9 was $20 million instead of $67 million, it would make sense with their current cost and weight. This goal could be moved significantly closer, if space optimized data center systems were available - primarily shielding and cooling systems. Orbital data centers could prove to be an important new revenue stream for launch providers and cloud services.

### Use Cases:
All other things being equal, given that moving large quantities of data is costly and time consuming: big data needs to be near its compute. And in orbit, big data is growing. Earth observation satellites are moving to high resolution synthetic aperture radar and multi spectral imaging. Space telescopes are in an exciting phase of discovery, and generating a several degrees of magnitude more data. Constellation's share of data is growing. Satellite constellations mesh comms are moving to free space laser communications which gives a tremendous bandwidth boost, but because the free space optical cannot tolerate clouds, the earth based radio gateways are a significant bottle neck. I have been told that 60% of Planet Labs revenue goes to third party radio base ground stations. I am a small Planet Labs stock holder and if this is true, I can understand that Planet Labs stock price is struggling. Processing data in orbit would help. 

National security workloads can be very time sensitive and for time sensitive applications the need for orbital processing is even more critical. One can imagine a security analyst asking an orbital AI about recent movements and getting a prompt answer rather than facing a delay as data downloads to a gateway and then to an earth-bound data center. 


### Opportunities:
Power supply to data centers has emerged as a significant bottle neck for the AI industry.  Mark Zuckenberg described power resources as an important limit for AI development. Various AI analysts suggest that finding a data center with sufficient power is more difficult than sourcing the hard to find Nvidia GPU. Zuckenberg also mentioned that the regulatory environment makes it likely that there might a a 5 year lead time for a new power plant in the 100's of megawatts. And he emphasized the need for data centers with gigawatt power. The long lead times for high capacity terrestrial power plants means alternative power sources are needed for these gigawatt demands. Solar power in orbit is cheap, continuous and without regulation.

In this short essay, I estimate that nuclear power has too much uncertainty, due to regulation costs of decommissioning, and politics. If people resist nuclear power in their backyards, they will doubly resist nuclear power largely for AI, in their backyards. I estimate that the uncertainty of future regulation of decommissioning, and long lead times will discourage developers.

It seems reasonable to compare earth based solar installations to orbital ones. Solar farms are well documented. A 150 megawatt solar farm which would require 150 acres and with a life span of 25 years can be built for $221 million, annualized at $8.8 million/year.

A solar panel in orbit receives 1.4 megawatts per square meter. The best space grade solar panels can harvest 33.3% of that. [Rocket Lab IMM-Î² for instance] At a beta angle of 90 degrees, the orbit allows sunlight 100% of the orbit. There is no night time.  So 150 megawatts can be provided by a panel of 10 by 30 meters, Instead of 150 acres. The solar cells are remarkably light at 49mg/cm2, so for the cells themselves, the weight would be 300 kg. If the infrastructure and structure is required to support them is roughly 4 times the weight of the cells themselves then the power infrastructure would weigh 4 * 300 kg or in other words $3.2M in lift expense to LEO by Falcon 9. The life time would be 5 years so annualized at $640K/year for the cost of launch.  So the cost of power, to the closest million, is close to the cost of the panels themselves.

The power density of the sun in orbit, sun @ 24 hours/day, and the light weight and efficiency of space grade solar cells makes this option very attractive. This attractive power density has led to many proposals for beaming orbital generated power to earth. This doesn't make sense. But using it in orbit does.

Free Laser Communications: Quantum key distribution cannot be done at distance by optical fiber as the internal reflections make it difficult to distinguish the resulting quantum state (as I understand it). Line of sight free laser coms between satellites are perfect from a distribution and security point of view. This makes it relatively easy to functionally aggregate smaller orbital data centers together, where physically larger data centers may be beyond current lift capacity. 

Global Connectivity: For global disaster response, especially if mediated by an AI, providing critical infrastructure for communication and analysis during disaster would be a benefit. Given future global remote education mediated by AI is likely, there is a case to be made for placing that data center in orbit as well. Disaster recovery and backup use cases might benefit as well.

Radio Spectrum Limits: Keeping data in orbit is increasingly important as the ability to grow the capacity of radio frequency ground station gateways has significant limits. The foot print of a radio transmission from a satellite is the size of a minor continent. And all of the countries in that footprint need to allot that frequency spectrum to your satellite. And one would like to have ground stations under as much of one's orbit as possible. So there is definitely a limit to available spectrum, and a limit to the number of locations of cooperative politically stable countries to allot that spectrum - which has to be paid for. (And whose spectrum would be free of potential jamming from a neighbor.) 

### Challenges: 
Costs: A data center on earth, in rule of thumb terms, costs $7 million to $12 million per megawatt of commissioned IT load. So 150 megawatt IT load would be between $1 billion and $1.8 billion.

How much datacenter could you fit in one Falcon 9 LEO launch at $67 million? 
One could load 16 racks of the latest from NVIDIA - 2 x 8x rack SuperPOD for Nvidia DGX GB200 NVL72 giving you 23 exaflops of FP4 computing. The power consumption would be 2 megawatts for the 576 CPU, 1152 GPU, with 480TB of memory. According to Nvidia, two of these racks can support a 54-trillion parameter model. (GPT-4 is said to be a 1.7-trillion parameter model.) Add 4 million for the satellite and solar array, and ground stations access.

If we assume that compute hardware costs (the cost of the CPU and GPU) are similar in the two cases,  the same 2 megawatts of IT load on earth would cost in the $20 million range plus $2 million for a solar farm ($1 million/megawatt) so to the closest million plus the CPU/GPU required->  $22 million. Roughly a 30% of current orbital costs of $71 million (both excluding the cost of the Nvidia SuperPOD.) 

## Conclusions: 
Terrestrial high performance compute is heavy, primarily because of liquid thermal control systems. These need to be optimized. A continued reduction in space launch costs, coupled with advances in lightweight power and thermal management solutions, will be the key factors to watch in making orbital data centers practical.  This use case could become a driver in space technology capabilities and an important new revenue stream for launch providers. And provide considerable benefits to global compute users.
