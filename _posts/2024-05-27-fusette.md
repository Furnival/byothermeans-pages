# Cat AI

Humans don't like pure disorder. Or just order. We like some disorder within limits. But we are connoisseurs of exactly what kind of disorder we really like - i.e. we need art. Perhaps there some hidden order in the disorder - but almost always it ins inside a frame - the ultimate order. Perhaps it is apocryphal: I remember learning that American Indian carpets only had borders on them after they were forced on reservation.

Considering disorder and A.I.: I have a recurring dream - that may someday turn into a short story. I work as cybersecurity in a university hospital and we have a cat that know when people are going to die and comes to their bedside to comfort them. A terminally ill French-Canadian lady names the cat 'Fusette' - the diminutive of 'fus√©e' or rocket in french, because the kitten-ish cat will disappear unexpectedly at all speed. This beloved cat has passed away finally, like her patients. An animal intelligence researcher in the university, as an experiment, has created an AI based on a cat, in order to better understand the cat brain - on the way perhaps to understanding higher mammals like us.

This cat AI has near human intelligence. My dream does not explain how the cat intelligence is studied, understood or simulated. Ther is something about statistical simulations of the different areas of the cat brain at 95% fidelity, based on experimental data, and then assembling them. My dream is about how I found the virtual cat on the hospital network and how she goes to each bedside of a patient about to die, residing in the equipment and monitors around them, and comforts them. And it was never programmed to do that. The patients name her Fusette. Of course to some, the AI is behaving like a computer virus, infecting the network and equipment.

AI commentators tell us, we will be so happy to have an A.I. doctor, 24x7, at our bedside when we are in a future hospital. I don't think so.

We don't want to be surrounded by order when we die.
